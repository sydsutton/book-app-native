# _YourShelf Portfolio Project_



#### By _**Andrew Sutton**_

#### _This is my third portfolio project meant to be a practical book-search app where you can save books to your "bookshelf" and customize your account._

## Technologies Used

* _Expo v41_
* _React v16.13.1 _
* _React Native_
* _Expo v41_
* _React Navigation Bottom Tabs v6.0.9_
* _React Navigation v4 _
* _React Redux v4.1.2_
* _Moment v2.29.1_
* _Expo Image Picker v10.1.4_

## Description

_This is a React Native app created with Expo. I used Android Studio and an AVD, and opened the project with a Pixel 4. You can open this app on the web, but some of the sizing might not be accurate. You can search for a book either by title or by subject. Click "save" will push the book into the saved page, then you can either remove it or say that you've read it. If you say that you've read it, it will be pushed into your "shelf" in your profile where you can remove it from there if you want._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _All of the book information is pulled from an open-source API._
* _I used Android Studio and an AVD to build and run this app._
* _Open your Android Virtual Device_
* _expo install_
* _expo start_
* _Run on android device/emulator_

## Known Bugs

* _If you create an account and log in, then go to the home page to save a book, it might log you out, forcing you to create an accout again. From what I can tell, this should happen only once. I'm still trying to figure that bug out._
* _Clicking "more info" will sometimes launch two modals for the same book_
